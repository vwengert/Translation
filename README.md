# Translation
Translation Service sample


[![Build Status](http://bertolux.dynv6.net:8153/buildStatus/icon?job=Translationservice)](http://bertolux.dynv6.net:8153/job/Translationservice/)



Simple REST API with either mariadb or List<>.

Service is configurable with translation.service.implementation either LIST or MARIADB. Default will be DB.

Repository adds a custom function which relies on a configurable element, which get autoinjected.

Tried to have a full test coverage.
